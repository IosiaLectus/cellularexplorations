# Cellular Explorations

This repository will contain a collaborative project on the topic of cellular automata. In particular, we want to implement 1 and 2 (and possibly higher) dimensional cellular automaton and explore the following questions:

1. Different tilings
2. More that two states
3. Can we implement rules with specific and the results of those rules
4. Interfaces
5. Different neighborhoods
